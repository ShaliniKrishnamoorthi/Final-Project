			<h2>THE HOTEL</h2>
 			<p>
				Bouganvilla is an old colonial style bungalow that has been renovated to include modern amenities retaining the old world charm and sits pretty on a 1 acre landscaped area. It is conveniently located 1km from the Ooty Bus stand and railway station, yet withdrawn from the hustle and bustle of the town. Bouganvilla is luxury that feels like home. It is an excellent place to relax and unwind and take back pleasant memories of your stay in Ooty.
			</p>
			<p>
				Apart from the Hall, the Lounge and the Dining, there are currently four rooms at Bouganvilla. Each room is unique and can accommodate different family sizes or groups. All rooms are spacious and have private entrances, flat panel televisions with cable, working fireplaces in some, luxury baths with tubs and other modern amenities.
